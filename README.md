## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js (version 14 or above)
- npm or yarn package manager
- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) (installed globally or as a project dependency)
- A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) supported by your NestJS application
- Prisma client set up and connected to your database

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SujoySust/Nestjs-Simple-Auth-With-Jwt-Passport.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd nestjs-simple-auth-restapi
```
3. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install or yarn install
```
4. Configure your database connection by updating the configuration file: prisma/schema.prisma

5. Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables:
```bash
npm prisma db push or yarn prisma db push
```
## Usage

To use the authentication setup provided by JwtAuthGuard, follow these steps:

Include the JwtAuthGuard in your route or controller using the @UseGuards() decorator:

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, UseGuards } from '@nestjs/common';
import { User } from '../../models/db/user.model';
import { UserEntity } from '../../../libs/decorators/user.decorator';
import { JwtAuthGuard } from '../../../libs/auth/auth.gaurd';

@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard())
@Controller()
export class UserController {
  @Get('/profile')
  async profile(@UserEntity() user: User): Promise<User> {
    return user;
  }
}
```
## Configuration

To configure the authentication setup, you may need to modify the following files:

config/jwt.config.ts: Adjust the JWT secret, expiration time, and other configurations to suit your needs.

Make sure to review and modify the configurations according to your specific application requirements.
